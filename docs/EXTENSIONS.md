# Extensions — future capabilities for the Global Brain

## Overview

Extensions expand the NeuroSwarm ecosystem beyond the core Global Brain. They enable additional compute, markets, and interoperability while remaining optional components that increase capability and resilience.

## Responsibilities

- Integration with decentralized GPU and compute networks to provide on-demand training, verification, or heavy inference workloads.
- Support for dataset marketplaces that attach licensing, provenance, and privacy metadata to assets; enable discoverability and commercial flows while preserving audit trails.
- Cross-chain registries and bridges that allow interoperability with other token ecosystems, identity systems, or proof sources.

## Relation to Global Brain

- Extensions are not part of the canonical aggregation or consensus path, but they enrich the ecosystem by providing additional services and commercial channels.
- Properly designed extensions should be opt-in and governed to avoid centralizing critical functions.

## Example extension patterns

- Decentralized GPU integration: scheduling, bidding, and attestation flows for rented GPU cycles with on-chain receipts.
- Dataset marketplace: on-chain listing metadata, off-chain encrypted storage, access control via staking/payments, and royalty splits for dataset owners.
- Cross-chain registry: canonical mapping of external IDs to NeuroSwarm manifests (with attestations and confidence scores) to enable multi-chain references.
