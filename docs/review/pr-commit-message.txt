CI/E2E: Stabilize Admin Node tests, add SafetyService, and enforce reproducible CI

This PR addresses stability issues surrounding Admin Node e2e tests and CI reproducibility. Key changes include:
- Pin Playwright to a stable version for test stability.
- Enforce deterministic installs using `pnpm -C admin-node install --frozen-lockfile` with a CI lockfile validation step (check `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- Update seed scripts to compute and write the real `genesisSha256` to `governance-timeline.jsonl` (repo root) and `admin-node` copy so admin observability endpoints match seeded data.
- Add `SafetyService` (safe mode + `POST /v1/admin/shutdown`) to protect mutating endpoints under maintenance.
- Improve `AnchorService` to respect `verificationStatus` and support multiple txSignature fields returned by observability.
- Harden Playwright e2e tests with proper auth headers, robust selectors, clipboard & permission handling, and serial execution to avoid global state conflicts.

- Publish Playwright artifacts (HTML report, test results, screenshots, traces) to PRs for easier debugging and review.
- Cache Playwright browser downloads to reduce CI time.

Files/areas changed (high-level):
- `admin-node/` — safety service, seed script updates, services, routes, unit/integration tests, e2e tests.
.github/workflows/admin-node-integration.yml and `.github/workflows/pr-checklist.yml` — enforced pnpm install, Playwright validation, seed timeline step, serial e2e tests (`--workers=1`).
- `docs/review/` — PR checklist (`pr-checklist-ci.md`), PR body (`pr-body-ci.md`), and PR commit message (`pr-commit-message.txt`).

Why this matters
- CI stability and reproducibility are essential for developer velocity and rapid PR iteration. Improving seeding, test determinism, and adding safe mode protect both tests and production behavior.

Validation steps and reviewer tips
- Use `docs/review/pr-checklist-ci.md` as the main reference for validation steps.

Quick commands:
1) Local unit & integration tests
```powershell
cd admin-node
pnpm -C admin-node install --frozen-lockfile
npm test
```
2) Playwright E2E (serial for deterministic results)
```powershell
npx playwright install --with-deps
npx playwright test -c e2e/playwright.config.ts --project=chromium --workers=1
```

Notes:
- Run Playwright in serial (`--workers=1`) while we have global state toggles, e.g., shutdown tests.
- If you want to test locally without committing: run `./admin-node/scripts/run-pr-checklist.ps1` (PowerShell) or `./admin-node/scripts/run-pr-checklist.sh` (Bash).
