# NeuroSwarm Knowledge Base

## Welcome & Overview

**NeuroSwarm** is a decentralized AI coordination platform that enables secure, transparent, and collaborative machine learning across distributed networks. By combining blockchain-based governance with advanced AI orchestration, we create a self-sustaining ecosystem where AI agents can collaborate, learn, and evolve while maintaining user sovereignty and data privacy.

This Knowledge Base serves as your comprehensive guide for onboarding as a contributor, understanding our governance model, and exploring our technical architecture. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or community member, you'll find structured pathways to participate in building the future of decentralized AI.
