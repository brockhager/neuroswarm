# Contributing to NeuroSwarm

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NeuroSwarm! This guide covers how to contribute to our decentralized AI ecosystem, including code, documentation, governance, and community activities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read the [Quickstart Guide](../onboarding/quickstart.md)** - Get oriented in 15 minutes
2. **Set up your environment** following [Getting Started](../onboarding/getting-started.md)
3. **Pick an issue** from the [Kanban board](../governance/kanban.md)
4. **Join our community** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/neuroswarm)

## 📝 Documentation Structure

All documentation must be placed in the `/docs/` directory with proper categorization:

### 📁 Documentation Organization Rules

| File Type | Location | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Subsystem READMEs** | `/docs/general/` | Component documentation, API guides |
| **Governance Docs** | `/docs/governance/` | Voting procedures, charters, contributor portal |
| **Technical Architecture** | `/docs/program/` | Smart contracts, blockchain integration |
| **Network/Node Docs** | `/docs/networking/` | Gateway, indexer, validator specifications |
| **API Services** | `/docs/services/` | Backend services, storage, extensions |
| **Web Interfaces** | `/docs/web/` | Frontend design, user experience |
| **Infrastructure** | `/docs/infra/` | Repository management, CI/CD, tooling |
| **Getting Started** | `/docs/onboarding/` | Quickstart guides, setup tutorials |
| **Everything Else** | `/docs/misc/` | Economics, security, proposals, events |

### 📋 Documentation Standards

- **Use Markdown** (.md) format exclusively
- **Relative links** for internal references (e.g., `../governance/kanban.md`)
- **Clear headings** with consistent hierarchy
- **Cross-reference** related documentation
- **Update links** when moving or renaming files

### 🚫 Documentation Rules

- **Never place .md files outside `/docs/`** - The sync agent will reject such PRs
- **Keep filenames descriptive** and consistent with existing patterns
- **Update navigation** when adding new documentation sections

## 💻 Code Contributions

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make changes** following our [development guide](../misc/development.md)
4. **Write tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Commit with clear messages**: `git commit -m 'Add: feature description'`
7. **Push and create PR**

## 📁 File Placement Rules

To maintain a clean and organized monorepo structure, all files must be placed in their appropriate subsystem directories. The sync agent and CI will automatically enforce these rules.

### Monorepo Structure

```
neuroswarm/
├── neuro-program/     # Solana programs and smart contracts
├── neuro-services/    # Backend APIs and services  
├── neuro-web/         # Frontend interfaces
├── neuro-shared/      # Shared utilities and types
├── neuro-runner/      # Node runner and orchestration
├── neuro-infra/       # Infrastructure and deployment
└── docs/              # All documentation
```

### Placement Rules

- **Code files**: Place in the appropriate subsystem directory (e.g., `neuro-program/src/`, `neuro-services/src/`)
- **Configuration files**: Place in subsystem root (e.g., `neuro-program/package.json`, `neuro-program/Cargo.toml`)
- **Documentation**: All `.md` files must go in `docs/` subdirectories
- **Scripts and tooling**: Place in `neuro-infra/scripts/` or subsystem-specific locations
- **CI/CD workflows**: Place in `neuro-infra/.github/workflows/`

### 🚫 Prohibited Locations

- **Never place files in the monorepo root** - CI will reject PRs with stray files
- **No code outside subsystem directories** - Except shared utilities in `neuro-shared/`
- **No documentation outside `docs/`** - Use appropriate subdirectories

### Automated Enforcement

- **Sync agent**: Automatically moves misplaced files during PR review
- **CI checks**: Fail PRs with files in prohibited locations
- **Audit logging**: All file moves are logged in `wp_publish_log.jsonl`

### Repo-Scoped Folder Creation (New)

To maintain repository integrity, all automated folder creation is restricted to the `neuroswarm/` repository root and its subdirectories (`docs/`, `src/`, `wiki/`, etc.). Scripts or tools that create folders must ensure that:
- Paths are validated and normalized to be inside `neuroswarm/` (not the monorepo root or higher)
- The default placement for new folders is `neuroswarm/<subdir>/` (for example, `neuroswarm/tmp/`)
- If a script receives an invalid path, it must abort and log the error clearly:

```
ERROR: Attempted to create folder outside repo root. Operation blocked.
```

Errors must include the requested path and a short message instructing the contributor to place files inside `neuroswarm/`.

If no valid `subdir` is provided to a script or tool, it must default to `neuroswarm/misc/` and log a warning.

Examples:
- Correct: `neuroswarm/tmp/wiki-clone/` (allowed)
- Incorrect: `tmp/wiki-clone/` (outside `neuroswarm/`) — blocked

CI and local scripts will use the `repoScopedFs` helper (`neuroswarm/scripts/repoScopedFs.{mjs,cjs}`) to enforce these rules. Please use the helper when writing new scripts that create directories.

Violations will be automatically corrected, but please follow these rules to avoid delays in your PR review.

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Follow ESLint rules and Prettier formatting
- **Rust**: Follow standard Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- **Solana/Anchor**: Follow program development best practices
- **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs and complex logic

### Subsystem-Specific Guidelines

Each subsystem has its own README with specific contribution guidelines:
- **[neuro-program](../general/neuro-program-README.md)** - Smart contracts and blockchain logic
- **[neuro-services](../general/neuro-services-README.md)** - Backend APIs and services
- **[neuro-web](../general/neuro-web-README.md)** - Frontend interfaces
- **[neuro-shared](../general/neuro-shared-README.md)** - Shared utilities and types
- **[neuro-runner](../general/neuro-runner-README.md)** - Node runner and orchestration
- **[neuro-infra](../general/neuro-infra-README.md)** - Infrastructure and deployment
