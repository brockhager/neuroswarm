# neuroswarm — Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the neuroswarm project. This `docs/README.md` is the canonical starting place for project-level documentation. Use this file to link to module docs, architecture notes, user guides, and developer HOWTOs.

## Quick links

Jump directly to the main documentation pages in this folder:

- [Architecture](./architecture.md)
- [Decentralized Chatbot System](./decentralized-chatbot-system.md)
- [Global Brain Design](./global-brain-design.md)
- [Governance](./governance.md)
- [Master Documentation Outline](./master-documentation-outline.md)
- [Personal AI Economy](./personal-ai-economy.md)
- [Terms & Metaphors (glossary)](./TERMS.md)
- [Tokenomics (NST)](./TOKENOMICS.md)
- [This index (README)](./README.md)


## Purpose

This folder is where we collect all design documentation, architecture diagrams, usage guides, and contribution notes for the neuroswarm system. Keep docs in Markdown and prefer short, focused pages that link together.

## Suggested structure

- docs/README.md — this file (project docs index)
- docs/architecture.md — high-level architecture and system components
- docs/getting-started.md — setup and quickstart for contributors and users
- docs/development.md — developer workflow, build, tests, and code style
- docs/modules/<module>.md — per-module documentation
- docs/diagrams/ — images and diagrams (keep sources in `diagrams-src/` if needed)

## How to add docs

1. Create a new Markdown file under `docs/` with a descriptive name.
2. Link it from `docs/README.md` or an appropriate index page.
3. Follow the repo Markdown and style conventions. Keep sentences short and include examples where helpful.

## Doc template (suggested)

- Title
- Short summary (1–2 paragraphs)
- Why it exists (purpose)
- Usage examples or code snippets
- Configuration and environment notes
- Links to related docs and issues

## Contribution

- Open a draft as a branch named `docs/<short-topic>`.
- Include a short description in the PR body about what the page adds or updates.
- Non-controversial fixes (typos, formatting) can be pushed directly if you have commit access.

## Next steps

- Add `getting-started.md` with a minimal setup and run guide.
- Add `architecture.md` with a diagram and component descriptions.
- Consider adding a small script to build a static doc site (optional).

If you want a specific page created next (for example `getting-started.md`), tell me which one and I can add it now.

## Master documentation

This repo now includes a master documentation outline that centralizes the entire design and suggested documentation flow.
