# Welcome to NeuroSwarm

## Mission
NeuroSwarm is building a decentralized AI platform that emphasizes transparent governance, contributor-first collaboration, and auditable decision-making. This wiki is the centralized source for onboarding, architecture, governance, and operational playbooks.

## Quick Start
1. Check out our contributor onboarding guide: [Contributor Onboarding](Contributor-Onboarding.md)
2. Set up your dev environment: `pnpm install -w` and run the Admin Node tests (see [CI-CD-and-Testing](CI-CD-and-Testing.md))
3. For governance rituals and proposer flow: [Governance & Anchoring](Governance-Anchoring.md)

## Contributor Quick Links
- New contributor? Start with a small documentation PR: [How to Contribute to the Wiki](How-to-contribute-to-the-wiki.md)
- Need to run tests locally? Use the PR Checklist helper script: `admin-node/scripts/run-pr-checklist.ps1` (or `.sh`)
- Want to verify the genesis anchor? Follow the guide: [Contributor Genesis Anchor Verification](../contributor-anchor-verification.md)
