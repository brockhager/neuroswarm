## About

NeuroSwarm is a decentralized AI platform where personal AI agents run locally on user devices and connect to a shared Global Brain. The system combines local personalization with collaborative, auditable knowledge sharing.

## What it does

- Agents learn and personalize locally.
- Agents can propose knowledge (facts, updates, small model deltas) to the network.
- Proposals are validated by a decentralized consensus of validators and, if accepted, added to the Global Brain.
- Participants earn rewards (tokens and reputation) for useful, verifiable contributions.

## Who can participate

- Anyone can run their own Personal AI locally.
- Users may opt in to submit proposals, stake tokens, act as validators, or provide compute and services.
- Participation is open to individuals, researchers, and organizations that follow the protocol rules.
