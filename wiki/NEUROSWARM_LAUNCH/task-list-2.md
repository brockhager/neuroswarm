# NEUROSWARM_LAUNCH — Task List 2 (Agent 4 Integration)

This task list translates the Master Design Document (MDD) into a prioritized, actionable implementation backlog for Agent 4 (Discord/Swarm Chat integration) and adjacent foundational services that must be implemented or refactored to achieve v1.2 compatibility.

> NOTE: This file focuses on the Agent 4 integration and immediate dependent platform work required to meet the MDD commitments. Tasks are grouped and prioritized as HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.

## Recent updates — status snapshot (2025-12-03)

- Router API prototype has been hardened: JWT verification (HS256 + RS256) and JWKS remote JWKSet support added; RBAC middleware and server-side artifact validation are implemented and covered by unit + integration tests.
- Pinning persistence has been upgraded for higher-fidelity E2E: in-memory -> file-backed JSON -> SQLite-backed (better-sqlite3) with a runtime fallback to file storage when native modules cannot be built. Local tests will use the fallback; CI is now configured to install build tooling and assert the SQLite path in CI runs (EXPECT_SQLITE=true).
- Agent 9 (Discord) end-to-end ingestion tests covering upload validation, ingestion, and pinning were added and pass locally; CI has a dedicated Agent9 E2E workflow and Router API CI now enforces the SQLite-backed path for higher-fidelity persistence in CI.

Next steps: migrate mock persistence to a durable DB (Postgres) for production, design pin retention and archival policies, implement on-chain anchoring (VP → ns-node), and add CI gating to ensure these production-grade paths remain green.

## 1. Core Network Implementation Tasks

ID | Component | Task Description | Priority | Status
---|-----------|------------------|--------|:--
CN-01 | ns-node (3009) | Implement full canonical node logic: block validation, consensus enforcement, robust reorg handling, and governance RBAC enforcement. Include thorough unit tests and integration contracts with Router API. | HIGH | Not Started
CN-02 | Router API (4001) | Implement security and anchoring: JWT middleware, RBAC, Postgres schema/migrations, deterministic audit hashing, IPFS pinning pipeline, and optional on-chain anchoring tests. | HIGH | In Progress (prototype hardened)
CN-03 | VP Node (4000) | Implement consensus engine: poll Gateway mempool, deterministically build blocks, compute payloadCid and sourcesRoot, sign headers, submit to ns-node, and provide metrics. | HIGH | Not Started
CN-04 | Gateway Node (8080) | Implement admission control: mempool management, per-IP and per-key rate limiting, adapter sandboxing, and requeue endpoints for reorg handling. | HIGH | Not Started

## 2. AI / LLM Service Refactor Tasks

ID | Component | Task Description | Priority | Status
---|-----------|------------------|--------|:--
AI-01 | NS-LLM (3015) | Refactor for streaming support: implement SSE token-by-token streaming on `POST /api/generate`, ensure fallback behaviour to HTTP prototype/native binary, add contract tests. | HIGH | ✅ Completed
AI-02 | NS-LLM (3015) | Implement embedding API: add `POST /api/embed` endpoint with deterministic embedding schema and tests; ensure low-latency and robust errors. | MEDIUM | ✅ Completed

### Completed (Sprint A work)

- ✅ AI-01 — NS-LLM `/api/generate` streaming + fallback implemented (SSE streaming, HTTP fallback, native shim support). OpenAPI contract (`openapi.yaml`) and integration tests were added.
- ✅ AI-02 — `/api/embed` endpoint tested and included in integration tests.
- ✅ AG4-01 — Agent 9 updated to consume streaming tokens; sample client and bot edits were added for streaming UX with a synchronous fallback.

- ✅ AG4-02 — Agent 9 artifact ingestion (A9-02) completed: added ipfs-http-client integration with deterministic CID fallback for dev, implemented robust file validation and sanitization in the Discord bot (size/type limits + filename normalization), and added unit tests covering deterministic CID generation, IPFS add, and upload validation.

> Note: This is a bot-side hardening step — the Router API still needs server-side enforcement (validation, pinning policy) and production-grade authentication (JWT/RBAC) to complete the end-to-end secure ingestion pipeline.

### Follow-up tasks created after Sprint A

- OPS-CI-NSLLM | CI: Add NS-LLM integration tests and OpenAPI contract validation into CI pipeline | HIGH | Not Started
- E2E-01 | End-to-end smoke & contract tests across services (Agent 9 ↔ NS-LLM ↔ Router ↔ VP ↔ ns-node) | HIGH | Not Started
- AG4-05 | Agent 9 streaming UX hardening: backpressure, edit throttling, resumable streams, and improved error handling | MEDIUM | Not Started

## Agent 4 Task List: Priority Focus — Agent 9 Completion

This list prioritizes the implementation of the Future enhancements defined in Section 9 of the MDD, which will transform the bot from a simple gateway into a core network interaction tool.

### 1. Agent 9 Core Enhancements (Discord Feature Parity)

These tasks integrate the Discord bot with the network's decentralized features (Router API, ns-node).

ID | Component | Task Description | Priority | Status | MDD Feature
:-- | :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
A9-01 | Agent 9 | Multi-Agent Conversation Routing: Implement routing logic to allow users to invoke and coordinate other agents (Agent 3, Agent 7, etc.) within a single Discord thread. | HIGH | Not Started | Multi-agent conversations
A9-02 | Agent 9 | IPFS Attachment Support: Develop handlers to securely process user-uploaded files, calculate the content hash, and submit the artifact to the Router API (4001) for IPFS pinning. | HIGH | ✅ Completed | IPFS Attachment Support
 - ✅ Bot-side hardening completed: added ipfs-http-client integration, deterministic CID fallback for dev, strict file validation (size/type), filename sanitization, and unit tests.
 - ⚠️ Server-side follow-up: Router API must enforce the same validation, pinning policy, and add JWT/RBAC before production enablement.
 - ✅ Server-side E2E coverage added: JWKS verification (RS256), file-backed pinning mock (later upgraded to SQLite-backed fallback for higher-fidelity testing), and Agent 9 → Router E2E tests added in `discord/tests/e2e/ingestion.test.mjs`.
 - ✅ CI updated: Router API CI installs OS build tools and asserts the SQLite path (EXPECT_SQLITE=true) — this ensures high-fidelity persistence path is executed. Agent 9 E2E workflow has been added to CI and also configured to expect SQLite in CI runs.
A9-03 | Agent 9 | Governance Voting Commands: Implement command handlers (/vote, /propose) to allow users to submit voting transactions or governance proposals directly to the Router API (4001). | HIGH | ✅ Completed | Governance Voting Commands
 - ✅ Bot-side: /vote handler integrated and wired to Router prototype. Add server-side validation & auth (JWT/RBAC) for production.
A9-04 | Agent 9 | Personal Agent Deployment: Implement the workflow for users to define and deploy custom, personalized AI configurations via a Discord command interface (integration with future Personal AI marketplace feature). | MEDIUM | Not Started | Personal agent deployment

### 2. Supporting Infrastructure & API Contracts

These tasks are necessary to support the advanced features above and remain critical to the In Progress list.

ID | Component | Task Description | Priority | Status | Related MDD Status
:-- | :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
RA-01 | Router API (4001) | Implement Governance Endpoint: Create the authenticated endpoint in the Router API to receive and validate governance/voting transactions from Agent 9 (Required for A9-03). | HIGH | Prototype | ✅ Prototype available (router-api-prototype/server.js) — **Security hardened (HS256 + RS256 + JWKS verified), RBAC enforced, unit & integration tests added (HS256/RS256/JWKS), README and CI workflow present**. Remaining work: DB persistence & anchoring pipeline for production.
RA-02 | Router API (4001) | Implement Artifact Ingestion Endpoint: Create the authenticated endpoint to receive IPFS content hashes and metadata for pinning and anchoring (Required for A9-02). | HIGH | Prototype | ✅ Prototype available (router-api-prototype/server.js) — **Server-side validation implemented (CID checks, metadata validation, size/type limits), HS256/RS256/JWKS validation supported, tests and CI workflow added, README added, mock pinning & DB store added for E2E verification**. Remaining work: pinning policy, durable storage, on-chain anchoring and production auth integration.
-- Server TODO: enforce server-side validation (size/type/content checks), pinning policy & production auth (JWT/RBAC) before enabling public ingestion.
OPS-01 | All Services | Prometheus/Grafana Dashboards: Focus on integrating metrics for Agent 9 performance (latency, token usage, command volume, connection health). | HIGH | In Progress | 🚧 Work in progress (dashboard & metrics integration)

This focused list ensures that the Discord experience is fully developed first, leveraging the in-progress backend services where necessary. Coordinate A9 tasks with the Router API team so RA-01/RA-02 are available as gates for the high-priority Agent 9 features.

## Acceptance Criteria (applies to all HIGH tasks)

- Unit tests with >80% coverage for new modules.
- Contract tests verifying request/response JSON structures among services.
- End-to-end smoke suite demonstrating basic happy-path flows.
- Prometheus metrics and `/health` endpoint implemented and queried by CI harness.
- Secrets managed via config (no plain tokens in code) and documented for CI/dev.

If you'd like, I can
- expand Sprint A into a concrete task breakdown (files, sample API contracts, test harness) for Agent 4 to start implementing immediately, or
- scaffold the NS-LLM streaming contract and a minimal test harness so Agent 4 can iterate quickly.

Which of these would you like me to do next (expand Sprint A or scaffold NS-LLM streaming)?
