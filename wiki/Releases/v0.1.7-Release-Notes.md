## Overview

Version 0.1.7 is an emergency hotfix release that addresses a critical bug in v0.1.6 causing infinite app spawning and system crashes. This release also includes UI improvements with a new dark navy blue theme.

---

## Critical Fixes

### 🚨 Infinite App Spawning Bug (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** The Electron desktop application would spawn infinite instances of itself, consuming all system resources and crashing the computer.

**Root Cause:** In `ns-node-desktop/main.js`, the server process was being spawned using `process.execPath`, which points to the Electron executable rather than Node.js. This caused each app instance to launch another Electron app instead of starting the Node.js server.

**Fix:** Changed line 31 in `main.js`:
```javascript
// Before (v0.1.6 - BROKEN)
serverProcess = spawn(process.execPath, [serverPath], { ... });

// After (v0.1.7 - FIXED)
serverProcess = spawn('node', [serverPath], { ... });
```

**Impact:** 
- **Affected:** All Windows users who launched v0.1.6
- **Severity:** System crash, potential data loss
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed in v0.1.7
