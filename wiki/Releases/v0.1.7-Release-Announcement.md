## 🚨 Critical Bug Fix

This is an **emergency hotfix release** that addresses a critical bug in v0.1.6 that caused the Electron desktop application to spawn infinite instances, leading to system crashes.

**If you downloaded v0.1.6, please delete it immediately and download v0.1.7 instead.**

---

## What's Fixed

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- **Fixed infinite app spawning bug** - The Windows Electron app was using `process.execPath` to spawn the Node.js server, which incorrectly pointed to the Electron executable itself instead of Node.js. This caused each app instance to spawn another Electron app in an infinite loop, rapidly consuming system resources and crashing computers.
  - **Impact:** Windows users experienced system crashes when launching the app
  - **Fix:** Changed to use `'node'` directly to spawn the server process
  - **Affected versions:** v0.1.6 only
