# Installation & One-click Local Setup (Archived)

> NOTE: This page was archived and replaced by the `Download` page in the Wiki.

This document provided a one-click local install flow for end-users to run NeuroSwarm nodes and for developers to build installers. The contents have been preserved in case we reintroduce the installation content later.

### Why archived
This page contained installer packaging and one-click instructions. We are temporarily removing the installation page from the wiki to reduce confusion while we stabilize the installer assets and packaging flow. Please use the `Download` page for release artifacts and the `Running Nodes` page for runtime commands.

The content is kept for historical purposes and to enable fast restoration if requested by the maintainers.
