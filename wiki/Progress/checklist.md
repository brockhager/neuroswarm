Here's a Phase G Contributor Checklist you can hand directly to your new agent. It's broken into clear categories with actionable items so they can pick tasks immediately:

🌐 Distributed Ecosystem Integration
Cross‑node orchestration layer: unify Data, Governance, and Contributor nodes with NS‑LLM.

Consensus protocol for hybrid scoring: ensure rules are applied consistently across nodes.

Federated caching system: share embeddings and generation results across nodes.

Integration documentation: contributor guide for connecting services across node types.

🛡️ Advanced Governance & Trust
Extend GovernanceService parameters: add minTokens, maxTokens, minCoherence, toxicityEnabled.

Implement contributor voting UI: expand Governance Dashboard with voting controls.

Blockchain anchoring verification: expose chain integrity checks in dashboard.

Governance metrics visualization: latency, throughput, and validation success rates.

⚡ Performance & Scalability
Streaming generation API: token‑by‑token output for real‑time apps.

Multi‑modal input support: extend NS‑LLM to handle text + images + structured data.

Cluster scaling: distribute inference across multiple GPUs/nodes.

Performance benchmarking: validate < 80 ms/token, > 20 req/s throughput.

CI/CD integration: automated performance tests in pipeline.

👩‍💻 Contributor Empowerment
Plugin system: allow contributors to add custom scoring/governance modules.

Dashboard extensions: visualize plugin outputs and richer metrics.

Learning hub: tutorials, starter kits, guided workflows.

Contributor onboarding scripts: zero‑setup binaries and Docker Compose updates.

Community rituals: voting participation and governance transparency.

✅ Success Criteria
NS‑LLM integrated across all node types with shared APIs.

Governance rules enforced consistently with anchored audit logs.

Performance targets achieved (< 80 ms/token, > 20 req/s).

Contributors can extend NS‑LLM via plugins and onboard in < 5 minutes.
