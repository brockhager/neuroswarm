# Top-Five Feature

## Overview
The **Top-Five** feature is a community-driven consensus mechanism designed to validate information and gauge sentiment within the NeuroSwarm ecosystem. Through a gamified, recurring voting process, contributors submit questions, the community prioritizes them, and then votes on the best answer from five options.

This feature integrates deeply with NeuroSwarm's governance and reputation systems, rewarding high-quality contributions and fostering a shared source of truth.
