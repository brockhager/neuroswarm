# NeuroSwarm Tokenomics & Sustainability Model

## Overview
The NeuroSwarm token system is designed to ensure **long‑term sustainability** by balancing two critical flows:
1. **Contributor Rewards** — motivating validators, developers, and consensus participants.
2. **System Growth** — funding infrastructure, governance, and preventing inflation through token sinks.

This dual‑flow model ensures contributors are incentivized while the platform remains scalable and self‑sustaining.

---

## Contributor Rewards (Sources)
- **Validator Rewards**  
  Nodes earn tokens for scoring generations honestly and consistently.
- **Plugin Developer Rewards**  
  Contributors earn tokens when their plugins (validators, visualizers, governance tools) are used.
- **Consensus Participation**  
  Nodes stake tokens to join consensus and earn rewards for correct behavior.

---

## System Growth (Sinks)
- **Plugin Fees**  
  Users spend tokens to load/run premium plugins.
- **Governance Costs**  
  Voting or proposal submission requires a small token fee to prevent spam.
- **Burn Mechanisms**  
  A fraction of tokens spent on services (plugin reloads, orchestration tasks) is burned to control inflation.
- **Infrastructure Funding**  
  Tokens flow into a treasury to support GPU scaling, contributor tooling, and community grants.

---

## Sustainability Balance
- **Circulation**  
  Contributors earn tokens → spend them on plugins, governance, or orchestration → tokens flow back into the system.
- **Deflationary Control**  
  Burn mechanisms prevent runaway inflation.
- **Growth Funding**  
  Treasury allocation ensures infrastructure evolves alongside contributor activity.

---

## Governance Integration
Tokens double as voting power in decentralized governance:
- Roadmap priorities
- Plugin approvals
- System upgrades

This ensures contributors have a direct stake in the platform’s evolution.

---

## Summary
The NeuroSwarm tokenomics model is both a **reward mechanism** and a **growth engine**:
- Rewards contributors for honest work and innovation.
- Funds infrastructure and governance to keep the system sustainable.
- Balances inflation control with circulation to maintain long‑term viability.
