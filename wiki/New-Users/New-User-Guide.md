# 🚀 Getting Started with NeuroSwarm

The easiest way to join the network is to download the pre-built application.

## 1. Download
Go to the **[Releases Page](../Releases.md)** and download the file for your computer:

- **Windows**: `ns-node-server-win-x64.exe`
- **Linux**: `ns-node-server-linux-x64`
- **Mac**: `ns-node-server-macos-x64`

## 2. Run
**Windows:**
Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file.

**Mac/Linux:**
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
chmod +x ns-node-*
./ns-node-*
```

## 3. Connect
Once the window opens or the terminal says "Started":
1. Open your browser to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
2. Click **"Enter Portal"** to join the swarm!

### ❓ Troubleshooting
**Issue 1: The window closes immediately**
- This usually means the port is busy. **Restart your computer** and try again.

**Issue 2: The browser didn't open**
- This happens sometimes. Just **[Click Here](http://localhost:3000)** to open it manually.

**Other Issues**
- **"Unsafe App"**: Click "More Info" -> "Run Anyway".
- **Browser Blocked**: Click "Keep" or "Allow" on the download.
