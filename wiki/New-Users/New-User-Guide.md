# 🚀 Getting Started with NeuroSwarm

The easiest way to join the network is to download the pre-built application.

## 1. Download
Go to the **[Releases Page](../Releases.md)** and download the file for your computer:

- **Windows**: `ns-node-server-win-x64.exe`

- **Mac**: `ns-node-server-macos-x64`

## 2. Run
**Windows:**
Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file.

**Mac/Linux:**
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
chmod +x ns-node-*
./ns-node-*
```

## 3. Connect
Once the window opens or the terminal says "Started":
1. Open your browser to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
2. Click **"Enter Portal"** to join the swarm!

### ❓ Common Issues
- **Browser Blocked Download**: Browsers may flag the file as "unsafe" because it's new.
  - **Chrome/Edge**: Click the 3 dots next to the download -> "Keep" -> "Show more" -> "Keep anyway".
  - **Firefox**: Click the download -> "Allow download".
- **"Unsafe App" Warning (Windows)**: Click "More Info" > "Run Anyway".
- **Port Error**: If it fails to start, make sure you aren't running another node on the same port.
