This script has moved to admin-node/scripts/content_sync.py

The content sync tool is admin-only tooling and therefore has been moved
under `neuroswarm/admin-node/scripts/` so ns-node users don't need Python.

Usage:
  python3 admin-node/scripts/content_sync.py --username <user> --password <app_pass> --content-dirs ./docs ./content
