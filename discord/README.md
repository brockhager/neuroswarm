# NeuroSwarm Discord Integration

This directory contains the Discord bot integration for NeuroSwarm governance notifications and server management.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy environment variables from the main NeuroSwarm project:
```bash
cp ../.env .env
```

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
- `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`
- Channel IDs (after running setup)

## Scripts

### Setup Discord Server
Creates roles, channels, and permissions for the NeuroSwarm governance server:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:
- Create governance roles (Founder, Admin, Contributor, Observer)
- Set up channel categories (Governance, Alerts & Monitoring, Community & Support)
- Configure channel permissions
- Output environment variable mappings for channel IDs

### Check Discord Status
Verifies bot connection and channel access:

```bash
npm run status
```

### Organize Channels
Reorganizes existing channels into proper categories:

```bash
npm run organize
```

## Channel Structure

### Governance Category
- `#genesis-anchors` - Genesis anchoring operations
- `#verification-results` - Independent verification results
- `#governance-logs` - Automated governance action logs
- `#timeline-feed` - Real-time governance timeline feed
- `#audit-trail` - Complete audit trail of all governance actions

### Alerts & Monitoring Category
- `#alerts-critical` - Critical system alerts and security notifications
- `#alerts-info` - Informational alerts and system updates
- `#system-health` - System health monitoring and status updates

### Community & Support Category
- `#onboarding` - New contributor onboarding and getting started
- `#faq` - Frequently asked questions and documentation
- `#discussion` - General governance and project discussion

## Usage in Admin Node

The Discord service is automatically integrated with the admin node for:

- **Governance Notifications**: Automatic posting of governance actions to relevant channels
- **Alert Broadcasting**: System alerts and critical notifications
- **Verification Results**: Independent verification outcomes
- **System Health**: Automated health check reports

## API Integration

The admin node provides REST endpoints for Discord operations:

- `POST /discord/send-onboarding` - Send onboarding guide
- `GET /discord/debug-channels` - Debug channel access
- `GET /discord-status` - Check bot connection status

## Environment Variables

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here
