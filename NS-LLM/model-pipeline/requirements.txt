# Optimum 2.x removed/changed the onnxruntime exports used by our exporter.
# Pin to any 1.x release to ensure import path `optimum.onnxruntime` remains available
# (quick unblocking fix; we'll upgrade to newer APIs in post-release cleanup).

# Pin NumPy to <2 to avoid ABI issues with prebuilt extensions compiled against NumPy 1.x
# (common on CI runners / older wheels). We keep this conservative pin to avoid runtime import errors.
